## StingyCD

This repository contains research implementations of StingyCD, StingyCD+, CD, and CD + Safe screening for
solving Lasso problems.  With minor changes, I used these implementations for our [2017 ICML 
paper on StingyCD](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/johnson17a.html).
Each branch corresponds to a different algorithm, and StingyCD is on master.
